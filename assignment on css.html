    EXERCISE 3
    <p class="fifth">The fixed bed adsorber is the most common and widely used adsorption system due to its simplicity and reliability. In this configuration, the adsorbent is packed tightly inside a column and remains stationary while the contaminated fluid flows through it, usually from top to bottom. As the fluid passes through the bed, pollutants are adsorbed onto the surface of the adsorbent particles.
Adsorption in a fixed bed does not occur evenly throughout the column. Instead, a region called the mass transfer zone (MTZ) forms, where active adsorption takes place. Over time, the adsorbent near the inlet becomes saturated, and the MTZ gradually moves toward the outlet. When contaminants start appearing in the treated effluent, breakthrough is said to have occurred.
Fixed bed adsorbers have several advantages. They have no moving parts within the bed, resulting in low mechanical wear and minimal particle loss. They are highly effective for removing low concentrations of pollutants and are commonly used for groundwater treatment, air purification, and drinking water applications. Their main limitation is that they operate in batches. Once the bed is exhausted, the system must be shut down for regeneration or replacement of the adsorbent. To maintain continuous operation, multiple beds are often installed in parallel. Despite these limitations.</p>
